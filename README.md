# parqdef
Parquet deformation experiments with D3.

Inspired by Douglas Hofstadter's article on "parquet deformations" in his Scientific American column Metamagical Themas (via his book which collected those articles). Parquet deformations originated from professor William Huff, who tasked his students with creating Escher-inspired "visual music". The minimum goal of this project is to allow people to easily create their own parquet deformations--hence, the "def" in "parqdef" stands for both "deformations" and "definitions".
