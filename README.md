# parqdef
Parquet deformation experiments with D3.

Inspired by Douglas Hofstadter's article in Scientific American (via his book which collected those articles) regarding the work of the students of William Huff, created Escher-inspired "visual music". The minimum goal of this project is to allow people to easily create their own Parquet deformations--hence, the 'def' in 'parqdef' stands for both parquet deformations and parquet definitions.
